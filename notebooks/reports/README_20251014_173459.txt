Model path: artifacts/model_char_svm.pkl
Labels path: artifacts/labels.npy
Num labels: 10
Notes:
- Character-level TF-IDF + LinearSVC pipeline loaded from artifacts.
- Batch inference expects a CSV with a 'text' column.
- If labeled CSV is provided, we compute classification report and confusion matrix.
- We also save low-confidence cases (by top-2 margin) for human review.
