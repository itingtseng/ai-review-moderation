# 🛡️ Ethics & Risk Governance — AI Review Moderation

### 1. ⚖️ Fairness & Bias
- **Potential Bias:** Linguistic bias across dialects or slang (e.g., regional expressions flagged as “aggressive”).  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Diversify training data across dialects and regions.  
  - Human review for low-confidence or sensitive classes.  

---

### 2. 🔐 Privacy
- All user IDs anonymized.  
- Text content scrubbed of emails, URLs, and phone numbers before embedding.  
- Processed data stored only for model training, not for production retention.

---

### 3. 🧠 Transparency
- Each decision accompanied by `reason`, `confidence`, and `similar examples`.  
- PMs and reviewers can trace prediction logic.

---

### 4. 🧍 Human-in-the-Loop
- Confidence threshold determines auto vs manual escalation:  
  - ≥ 0.8 → auto-flag  
  - < 0.8 → send for human review  
- Human reviewers provide feedback used for retraining.

---

### 5. 🔁 Continuous Monitoring
- Weekly retraining with new flagged data.  
- Drift detection pipeline (compare embedding centroid shift).
